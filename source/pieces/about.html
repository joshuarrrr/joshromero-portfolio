    <hr>
            <p>I’m an experienced digital journalist equally comfortable writing code and prose. I'm currently pursuing projects that involve data visualization, structured journalism, newsroom processes, and digital archives. I write and report about emerging technology, energy, physical science, and software systems.</p>
            <p>I previously worked as a digital editor at <a href="http://spectrum.ieee.org">IEEE Spectrum</a>, where I led product development of the website, CMS, and digital workflow tools. I also packaged in-depth features and special reports into engaging online experiences, shot and produced videos, and managed bloggers.</p>
