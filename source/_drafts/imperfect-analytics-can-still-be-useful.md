title: Newsroom Analytics Could be a lot better, but they'll never be perfect

Over the past year, there's been lots of discussion about the limitations (and even misuse) of common web publishing analytics. While I'm happy to see that publications (specifically, large publications) are getting more savvy with analytics, I worry that the overall lessons or recommendations for smaller websites are getting a bit muddled. Link-bait headlines like "The End of the Pageview" are arguably doing more harm than good. (Personally, I'll always be suspicious of writers proclaiming the end of anything, especially when they have a financial stake in a new, competing thing.)

So with that in mind, I'm hoping to sum up some of the thoughtful discussion of newsroom metrics and offer some practical advice for how even small publications can get more out of their web analytics.

## Measure What You're Trying to Accomplish

Let's start with the basic web metric that everyone is familiar with, the good old, much maligned, pageview. The pageview is an easy metric for journalists to hate, because it doesn't really align to our journalistic values of quality. While sometimes stories with high journalistic values attracts a lot of attention and traffic, more often in not they'll lose out to link-bait, gossip, and the infernal slideshow/gallery.

OK, so journalists don't want to measure popularity (or, more accurately, they don't want to measure *just* popularity). So what do we want to measure? This is where it starts to get interesting.

You've may have heard that what we should be measuring instead is "engagement": how users are interacting with stories once they're there. While engagement might be more useful to measure than pageviews, I don't think it really captures the real goals most newsrooms are trying to achieve. Here are some examples of editorial goals:

- To inform/educate
- To elicit an emotional response
- To spur citizen action/pressure
- To create a historical record
- To enthrall/entertain
- To win an award/recognition
- To change policy

### Legitimate Uses of the Pageview

- *Measuring minimum readership.* I've always been a bit disappointed that even though most editors work in a resource limited environment (limited print pages, limited editing time, limited budged), they rarely think in terms of each story earning a return on its investment. Now before you get out the pitchforks, let me explain that I'm not looking to turn a newsroom into some kind of soul-less spreadsheet bureaucracy. I'm not suggesting that every story, or even most stories need to go viral or generate a bunch of pageviews. But there should be a minimum threshold of people for a given story to reach--if no one is aware of the work we're doing how can it have any effect--and I'll go one step further by suggesting that the minimum threshold should scale somewhat with the amount of time and money that a story required.

### The Limitations of Measuring Engagement
Usually engagement is calculated by measuring the time a user spends with a story. Because time on site or time on page is not a very reliable metric (as reported by Google Analytics and most other platforms), more sophisticated analytics shops employ different techniques to actually determine the amount of time a user spends with a story.

Chartbeat, for instance, pings a user's browser every second to see if they are active active (by doing something on the page such as scrolling) or inactive (whether because you're reading what's already on the page or you've walked away from your computer). Upworthy takes a different approach by combining pageview and time spent data into a metric they call "total attention minutes." With this approach, a story where 1,000 users spend an average of 2 minutes is judged to be just as "successful" as an article where 12,000 users each spend 10 seconds.
