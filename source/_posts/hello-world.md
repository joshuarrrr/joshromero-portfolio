I finally got around to putting up a personal site. These are the tools I used to build it:

- **[Hexo](http://hexo.io/)** as my static site generator
	- **LESS** for wrangling styles
- **[Semantic.gs](http://semantic.gs/)** for building out the homepage grid
- **Git** for deployment to my DreamHost server
- **Sublime Text 2** as my editor
	- **[Emmet](http://emmet.io/)** is probably my favorite plugin

Stay tuned for more to come...
