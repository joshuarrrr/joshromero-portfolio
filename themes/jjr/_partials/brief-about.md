I’m a journalist and web developer interested in emerging technology, physical science, and global development.

I previously worked as an editor at [IEEE Spectrum](http://spectrum.ieee.org), where I shot and produced videos, wrote and edited articles, and helped lead two website redesigns.

Check out my [résumé](/resume.html) and get in touch if you're interested in working with me.
